            <h4><span>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What makes you different? <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></h4>
            <p>One of our key focus areas is Social Emotional Learning (in partnership with a US Youth Leadership organization: “Growing Leaders”), mentoring, and leadership development. We believe this is something that our young people need, especially in such challenging and unprecedented global times.</p>
            <p>We also prioritize the holistic development and wellbeing of our students, their families, and our staff and faculty, providing periodic group counseling sessions for parents and students with a PRC-registered Guidance Counselor. We provide genuinely caring support for families, and host monthly Parenting Peer Groups (PPGs), which are gatherings (online/virtual if in-person is not possible) of small groups of parents to provide moral support and academic support to one another.</p>
            <p>FCA accepts students from diverse backgrounds, religions, and walks of life. Our primary language used for teaching and communication is the English language, except for the subjects of Filipino, Araling Panlipunan, and certain topics under Home Economics and Livelihood Education/Technology and Livelihood Education.</p>

            <h4><span>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What are your Core Values? <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></h4>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i> Christ-centeredness: We regard the Bible as the highest authority on morality and spirituality. Our curriculum is Bible-based and our desire is that all who enter the doors of FCA will be impacted to become more Christ-like.</p>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i> Genuine Care and Love for People: The Scriptures command us to "...love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind," and to “love your neighbor as yourself.” We genuinely love and care for each other, our students, and their families, our donors, partners, and all stakeholders… and desire for them to walk in the fullness of the promise of abundant life. This desire drives us to pursue exceptional customer service and high client satisfaction. We also genuinely love and care for our employees. We aim to be a fun and meaningful place to work, and to provide a conducive environment that encourages collaboration of all stakeholders.</p>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i> Academic excellence - We desire to produce learners who are academically competent, able to be globally competitive, and who are critical, strategic thinkers.</p>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i> Leadership with Integrity - We desire to be a school that influences its people to become leaders of integrity – individuals who are honest, consistent, trustworthy, and governed by a moral compass.</p>
            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i> Real-life skills - We believe in preparing our students for life after formal schooling, and inculcating in them a strong work ethic, a passion for excellence, and real-life skills such as communication and critical thinking, as well as practical knowledge for daily life.</p>

            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i> FCA follows the K-12 Curriculum of the Department of Education, and integrates its core values. Many of our books are shipped from the USA, and modules are also printed by the school. FCA does its best to not overload its students; the amount of work assigned is very doable, as long as the student can focus during class times and is given support by his/her family. For assigning online tasks, FCA uses Google Classroom, and the Google Suite for Education. Click here for a quick introduction and tutorial.</p>
